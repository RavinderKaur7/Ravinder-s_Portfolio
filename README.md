# Ravinder Kaur - Data Analysis Projects
# Data Analyst
Hi, I'm Ravinder Kaur, As a data analyst with experience at Delphi Technology and Rogers Communications, I have honed my ability to extract, clean, and analyze complex datasets from multiple sources. My work has significantly improved operational efficiency, reduced reporting time, and facilitated data-driven decision-making for stakeholders. Additionally, I have a proven track record of building and maintaining KPI dashboards, streamlining workflows through cross-functional collaboration, and providing actionable insights that increase profitability across product lines. My ability to resolve technical issues and collaborate with teams in my previous role as a Technical Support Consultant has enhanced customer satisfaction and improved overall process efficiency.

I hold a Graduate Diploma in Internet Protocol Network and Telephony from Cegep De La Gaspesie et Des Iles and a Graduate Diploma in Information System & Business Analysis from Northern College. Most recently, I completed the Business Intelligence and Data Analytics Training Program at Techno Canada Centre of Excellence. These educational experiences have provided me with a strong foundation in data analytics, business intelligence, and telephony systems.

In addition to my technical skills, I have been involved in several volunteer initiatives, which have enhanced my leadership abilities and fostered a spirit of teamwork. I continuously seek to expand my knowledge through certifications and hands-on project work, with a focus on improving processes and driving meaningful results for organizations.

I am passionate about using data to unlock insights that lead to better decision-making and business outcomes. With my blend of technical expertise, problem-solving skills, and a commitment to lifelong learning, I am excited to bring value to teams that prioritize innovation, collaboration, and data-driven strategies.
