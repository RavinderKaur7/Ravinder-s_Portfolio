# Ravinder-s_Portfolio
# Data Analyst
Hi, I'm Ravinder Kaur, I have an analytical background in Data/Business Analytics. I have developed a strong foundation in the data analyst feild and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data  as data analyst.
I have recently completed Business Intelligence and Data Analytics Certificate program. I have worked with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in data cleaning, data management and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data analyst.
