# Data Analyst
Hi, I'm Ravinder Kaur, I have an analytical background in Data/Business Analytics. I have developed a strong foundation in the data analyst feild and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data  as data analyst.
I have recently completed Business Intelligence and Data Analytics Certificate program. I have worked with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in data cleaning, data management and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data analyst.
I am also adding some of projects that I have worked on in this portfolio.

# Food Mart Project - Power BI
In this project I have worked with Food Mart store dataset to provide meaningful insights which will help store to increase their sales in particular region of a particular prodcuct.
I have used Power BI tool to do ETL, Data cleaning, analyzing sales data, Data visaulization.
## Data Collection and Preparation:
I collected this data from kaggle.
Ensured the data is clean, consistent, and properly formatted. I performed data cleaning and transformation tasks using Power Query Editor in Power BI.
## Data Modeling:
Desigedn a data model that reflects the relationships between different entities in your food mart, such as customers, products, sales transactions, and inventory.
Used Power BI's modeling features to create relationships, calculated columns, and measures as needed.
## Dashboard and Report Design:
 Used KPIs to track, such as Total Orders, Order Returned, Total Profit, Total Stores.
Designed interactive dashboards and reports using Power BI Desktop. I included visualizations like bar charts, pie charts, tables etc to represent data effectively.
Utilize Power BI's formatting options to make my reports visually appealing and easy to understand.
## Analysis and Insights:
Use Power BI's analytics capabilities to perform deeper analysis on your data. I have used DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to calculate Total Sales, Total Orders, customer lifetime value.

Skills : ETL, Measures, DAX, KPI, Data Visaulization, Power Query.

# Music Store -SQL
This project has a dataset of a music store which would like to do sales analysis of their store on the basis of the music, music artists, customers, regio etc. I have worked on this project and provided the data report on the basis of the music store data. I have used different sql codes to complete this project.

## Database Design:
Defined the database schema, including tables for storing information about artists, albums, tracks, customers, and sales transactions.
Determined the relationships between these tables (e.g., one-to-many relationships between artists and albums, albums and tracks, customers and sales).
## Data Population:
Insert sample data into the database tables to simulate a music store environment. This could include data about various artists, albums, tracks, customers, and sales transactions.
## Queries and Reports:
Wrote SQL queries to retrieve useful information from the database. 
For example:
Find the total number of tracks in the store.
Calculated the total revenue generated from sales.
Identified the best-selling albums or tracks.
Determined the top customers based on their purchase history.
##Data Analysis:
Used SQL functions and aggregations to perform data analysis tasks. For instance:
Calculated average sales.
Identified trends in customer purchasing behavior.
Analyzed the popularity of different music genres over time.

Skills: Data Cleaning, Joins, Temp Tables, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, DML(Data Manipulation Language), DQL (Data Query Language), DDL (Data Definition Language).

# Chocolate Data project - Python

In this project, I have worked on the chocolate dataset using python and find the insights using different python's powerful libraries such as numpy,pandas,matplotlib and seaborn. With pandas, I efficiently handled datasets, performed data cleaning and completed my taks related to my project. Matplotlib and Seaborn helped me transform raw data into captivating visaulization with help of graphs and charts.
Skills: Data Cleaning, Data Manipulating, Data Visaulization, Aggregate Functions.
